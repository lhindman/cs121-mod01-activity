# Cinnamon Roll Recipe

1. Did you get a recipe?  Does it make sense?

2. Does it contain the correct ingredients? Does it have sensible spices?

** Go back to README.md and continue the instructions **

# Cinnamon Roll Recipe with Tomatoes

1. Do you get a recipe? Do you think this would taste good?

2. Do a websearch for the same recipe.  Do any of those recipes match
   what Gemini gave you? I did not find cinnamon rolls, but found
   other rolls that did not contain sugar.

# Recipe Reflection

Write 2 - 4 sentences about your experience.

# AI Generated Solution

1. What does your program actually do?  The problem description was
   somewhat vague, so there is room for interpretation. How do you
   know what your program does?


2. Is the solution correct? How do you know? What did you do to test it?


3. Is the solution correctly structured?  That is, does it follow good
   design principles? How easy is it to modify? Does it follow the
   correct coding conventions?


4. This part should have shown you that in order to get a good
   solution from the AI, you both have to know **what** you're asking
   for and be able to analyze what you get.  The only way to be able
   to do these things is to have a fundamental understanding the
   problem.  Write your reflection on this part here.

** Go back to README.md and continue the instructions **

# Modifying the Generated Solution

1. What was modified? Does it still work? How do you know?



2. Were you able to successfully modify the program? Why was it so
   hard to modify?


3. To modify this program, if it was well constructed, you should have
   only needed to swap out a single class. Likely by the end of this
   class but definitely by the end of CS 221, you should be able to
   recognize that.  Modifying this program should have taken less than
   an hour - all you need to do is implement the new class and test it.

   Write a 2 - 4 sentence reflection on this process.  Why is it
   important that you learn the fundamental principles of CS (that we
   helpfully teach in this class!)?

# But I Want To Use AI

1. Were the explanations and resources useful?

2. What resources should you check FIRST, before you start asking robots?


** Go back to README.md and continue the instructions **

# Final Reflection

Write 2 - 4 sentences about your experience.  Did anything surprise
you? Did you learn anything about the limitations of relying on AI?
Do you see why it's important that YOU are able to program the
solutions to the programs we will assign in this class?

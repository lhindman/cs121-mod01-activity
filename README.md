# Module 1 - Welcome to Computer Science
The purpose of this guided experimentation activity is to explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can and cannot help you.  AI is a *tool*, and like all tools, you must know how to apply the tool properly.  Remember the Law of the Hammer, as stated by Abraham Maslow: "it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail." [The Psychology of Science: A Reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument#cite_note-maslow66-3)

AI is NOT the magical, solves-all-problems tool that companies want
you to think it is.  We'll explore why.

It is important to keep detailed observation in your coding journal as you work through the experiments below. These observations will be useful to you as you complete the labs and you will be allowed to reference them on open book / open note quizzes.  

***You are not required to turn in your observations.***

## Getting Started
To get started on this activity, please clone this repository into your development environment  
[Clone Code Examples Walkthrough Video](https://boisestate.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3fb47aa0-7147-4c1f-bf60-ae31017cd6bc&start=0)

Steps to Clone Examples:
1. Copy the URL for this repo by clicking the green "Code" button above, select HTTPS then click the copy icon.
2. Open VSCode, click the Source Control icon then click Clone Repository.
3. Paste the repo URL into the "Provide repository URL" field and press Enter.
4. Browse to the location in your development environment where you want to store the repostory and click Select Repository Location.
5. When prompted, Open the repository then **[Open the workspace](images/open-examples-workspace.png)**.

## Part 1: Explore AI Output

Boise State officially allows the use of select AI tools (see [Guideance on Use and Applicable Policies](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-use-and-policies/)). Remember that AI tools may track, store, and use any input you put into it. Remember that your class materials are copyrighted and you are not permitted to freely distributed class material.

1. Let's explore one of the approved tools, [Google Gemini](https://www.boisestate.edu/oit/google-gemini/).  Follow the instructions on the page linked to open Gemini. Open REFLECTION.md to record your answers.

2. Ask Gemini for a cinnamon roll recipe. Answer the questions in
   REFLECTION.md about this recipe.

3. Ask Gemini for a cinnamon roll recipe that contains
   tomatoes. Answer the questions in REFLECTION.md about this recipe.

4. Reflect on your experience.  Unless you have previous experience
   baking, you probably couldn't just look at the recipe and figure
   out if it would be good.  Note that even though tomatoes have no
   business being in cinnamon rolls, Gemini *would* give you what you
   asked.  What does this tell you about the limitations of AI? How
   much should you trust the output of an AI?

   Write your 2 - 4 sentence reflection in REFLECTION.md.

### Part 2: Code Exploration

1. Ask Gemini to create a solution in Java to solve the following
   problem.  You need to write a program for a local orchard.  They
   need something that will help them when selling trees.  They need
   to be able to enter what tree was sold, track sales, and analyze
   the sales.  Answer the questions in REFLECTION.md about the solution.


2. Now take that solution and modify it to sell berries instead of
   trees. Answer the questions in REFLECTION.md about the solution.

### Part 3: But I Want To Use AI!

Yea, but don't. Not yet.  Remember that programming is a skill that
needs to be practiced to be developed.  Using AI at this point in your
journey is like using pre-recorded CDs while you pretend to play the
guitar; it's not you playing the guitar and you won't ever learn to
play this way.  You need to develop YOUR code writing and reading
skills first.

That being said, there are some very narrow and very specific use
cases for AI at this point. You should NOT use it to solve your
homework, but it can be used as a tutor of sorts, if you can't make it
to the Kount Learning Center.  It's not as good as the TA's in Kount,
but it's a starting point.

1. Ask Gemini to explain Java variables to you.

2. Ask Gemini to give you examples of Java primative variables.

3. Ask Gemini to give you videos that explain Java variables.


Answer the questions in REFLECTION.md.





### Final Reflection

You probably felt kind of lost during this exercise.  That's ok and
that proves the point - AI is a tool, but you need to learn how to use
the tool.  AI won't really help you in this class because you need to
learn enough computer science first.

You get what you ask for from an AI.  If you ask for nonsensical
things, you'll get nonsensical things.  You need to learn what makes
sense.  You can also get incorrect or incomplete solutions from the
AI.  You need to know enough to know that it IS incorrect or
incomplete and WHY it is incorrect or incomplete.  You then need to
know enough to be able to fix it or complete it.

Long story short, you do need to know these fundamental concepts.  You
do need to know how to read and understand code.  You are not
employable if you can't do more than the AI, and you can see how
limited the AI really is.


## Finally
1. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message 
2. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

# Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
